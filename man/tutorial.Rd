Introduction

Welcome to the altSplicing package! This package provides tools for analyzing alternative splicing data. The following tutorial will guide you through the installation and use of this package.

Installation

The altSplicing package can be installed from GitHub using the devtools package. To install altSplicing, run the following code:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("umranyaman/altSplicing")
```

Package Overview

The altSplicing package contains the following functions:

read_splice_data: This function reads in alternative splicing data from a file.
calculate_dpsi: This function calculates the delta PSI value for a given splicing event.
filter_splice_data: This function filters alternative splicing data based on delta PSI values.
plot_splice_data: This function plots alternative splicing data.

Usage

Let's start by reading in alternative splicing data from a file. The file should contain columns for gene name, exon ID, delta PSI values for two different conditions, and a p-value for the splicing event. The read_splice_data function can be used to read in this data:

```
splice_data <- read_splice_data("splice_data.txt")
```

Once you have read in the data, you can use the calculate_dpsi function to calculate delta PSI values for each splicing event:

```
splice_data$delta_psi <- calculate_dpsi(splice_data$psi_condition1, splice_data$psi_condition2)
```

Next, you may want to filter the data to include only events with a significant change in splicing. The filter_splice_data function can be used for this purpose:

```
significant_splice_data <- filter_splice_data(splice_data, p_value_cutoff = 0.05)
```

Finally, you can visualize the alternative splicing data using the plot_splice_data function:

```
plot_splice_data(significant_splice_data)
```

Conclusion

This tutorial provided an overview of the altSplicing package and how to use its functions. I hope that this package will be useful for your alternative splicing analysis
